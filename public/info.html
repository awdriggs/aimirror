    <h1>Information</h1>

    <p>AI Photobooth is like a digital mirror, reflecting how Artificial Intelligence models “see” us.</p>

    <section id="flow">
      <h2>How it works</h2>

      <p>A face is detected by an AI! You can click the button to capture your likeness.</p>
      <img src="imgs/capture.png"> <img src="svgs/arrow.svg">
      <p>The face is isolated.</p>
      <img src="imgs/boundingbox.png"> <img src="svgs/arrow.svg">
      <p>This image is sent to an Large Language Model for a caption.</p>
      <img src="svgs/arrow.svg">
      <p>A caption is returned...</p>

      <p>"The photo shows a person with medium-length, light brown hair. They are wearing a brown sweater over a white shirt. The background includes a window with a partially visible white frame and a light-colored wall. The lighting in the room appears soft and indoor, and there is a poster or piece of art visible on the wall behind them."</p>
      <img src="svgs/arrow.svg">
      <p>The caption is sent as a request to an image generator.</p>

      <p>An image is returned!</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>

      <p>This project arose as I was experimenting with LLMs as a creative collaborator through some <a href="https://current.ecuad.ca/what-is-critical-making&quot;">critical making</a> experiments. I was curious how AI “sees” us, and whether this would reveal any biases or limitations of the models.</p>
      <p>Most often the models will return  an “attractive” likeness, often reduced to some standard stereotypes i.e. male = facial hair, long hair = female.</p>
      <p>What is most interesting is when the model is unsure or struggles in some way. For example, if the caption expresses the inability to determine some salient features of a person, the image generator will respond with a blank faced person rather than make assumptions.</p>
